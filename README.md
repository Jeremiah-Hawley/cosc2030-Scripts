# How to setup
clone the repo into your home directory, then run:
```bash
mv cosc2030-Scripts/* ./
```
then edit hive.sh and change "yourUsername" to your username
then run
```bash
chmod +x hive.sh
```
and
```bash
chmod +x pi.sh
```
then you should be good!

# How to use
## hive
after you change your username in the file, you can just call it with ./hive.sh and then type in your password

## Pis
call it with the name after the script, so:
```bash
./pi.sh archer
```
for example.
